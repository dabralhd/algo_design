- Binary Heap
A binary heap is most common DS for implementing priority queues. A binary heap must satisfy 2 properties namely structure property and heap-order property.

structure property - a binary heap is a complete binary tree i.e. all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level at which nodes are filled from left to right.

Heap order property - Key stored at any given node in a min(max) heap is lower(higher) than key stored at its parent.
