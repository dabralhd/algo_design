## c++ containers

- list
Lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence, and iteration in both directions.

- forward list
Forward lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence.

- array
Arrays are fixed-size sequence containers: they hold a specific number of elements ordered in a strict linear sequence.

- vector
vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.

- set
Sets are containers that store unique elements following a specific order.

- map 
Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order.

Container Adapters

- queue
queues are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a FIFO context (first-in first-out), where elements are inserted into one end of the container and extracted from the other.

- priority queue
Priority queues are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed such that its first element is always the greatest of the elements it contains, according to some strict weak ordering criterion.

- stack
Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.
